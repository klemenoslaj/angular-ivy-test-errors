Steps to reprocude:
- `npm install` or `yarn`
- `ng test example --browsers=ChromeHeadless`

In case this does not work try instead `with-node-modules-npm` or `with-node-modules-yarn` branch respectively.  

**NOTE**: Please not that here all node_modules are pushed, therefore please skip the `npm install` and `yarn` commands
**NOTE 2**: Using `npm install` is more reliable in reproduction
